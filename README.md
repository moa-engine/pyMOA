# pyMOA üåê

**pyMOA** is a free and open source Python library that implements the MOA metasearch engine as a clean and easy-to-use client for Python. It allows you to seamlessly integrate web search into your Python programs.

The project is currently in alpha development, so there is no pre-built package.



## üîç Key Features

- **Privacy First**  
  No user data is stored or tracked during searches.

- **Metasearch Support**  
  Utilizes MOA under the hood to fetch and combine results from multiple search engines simultaneously.

- **Ad-free Search Results**  
  Clean, clutter-free search responses.

- **Open-source under GPL‚Äë3.0 License**  
  Use, modify, and distribute freely under GPL‚Äë3.0 terms.
